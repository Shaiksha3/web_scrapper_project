# web_scrapper_project

Here in this project I am going to scrap data of  flipkart products reviews,names, rating etc...

we are also linking the webscrapping with flask 

first run the file app.py before that install all the packages in requirements.txt

then your computer acts as a server then copy the link and add port number(5000) to the link and browse the website in mobile or laptop using the link 

now you see a webpage with search bar, where you can enter for the required product and then search 

as soon as you enter search button a new page is displayed with all the reviews ,names and rating in the from of a webpage
